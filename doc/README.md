# Project 07-dht

    IntroComp - Austral 2022 - EAM
    
##  Temperature and humidity measurement using DHT-XX sensor

    Using ESP32 development board

### Hardware

    1 Temperature and humidity sensor: DHT11 or DHT22
    1 10K resistor
    Jumper wires

###  Connections

    Connect Pin 1 of DHT-XX to 3.3 V
    Connect Pin 2 of DHT-XX to GPIO "DHTPIN"
    Leave Pin 3 of DHT-XX unconnected
    Connect Pin 4 of DHT-XX to GND

    Connect Pin 2 of DHT-XX to one side 10 K resistor
    Connect other side of 10 K resistor to 3.3V

###  Verification

    Each delay time (originally 2 seconds), read and print humidity and temperature
    in serial monitor
